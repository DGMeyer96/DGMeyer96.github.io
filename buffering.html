							<h2>How To Play</h2>
							<p>The game support up to 4 players locally with up to 4 controllers (Xbox One and Dualshock 4 supported) or 3 controllers and 1 keyboard and mouse player.  Players must choose from 4 different characters,
							each representing an archetype (tank, melee damage, ranged damage, support) to play as.  Each character has their own set of unique abilities.  Controls are similar to a twin stick shooter where characters
							have independent movement and aim.  To complete the game players must traverse each level while fighting off enemies.   There are 4 levels to complete followed by a boss level.</p>

							<h2>Development</h2>
							<p>For this project I had two roles: programmer and level designer.  As programmer I developed the splitscreen controls with controller support for up to 4 players.  I also created the scene transitions, loading, and main menu with graphics settings.
							As the level designer I prototyped and designed the majority of the levels for the game.  This included lighting, post effects, enemy placement, and level flow.  Each of these levels were created using the Infinity Blade assets as well as free water and sci-fi asset packs.</p>

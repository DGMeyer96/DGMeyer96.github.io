							<h1>About - </br>Project Ambrosia</h1>
							<p class="major">This project was developed in the <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/academic-technology-innovation">CSU San Bernardino Academic Technologies and Innovations</a> VR Lab
							for the Archeology Department at CSUSB.  The purpose of the project is to provide a supplemental experience for archeology students.  Up to 4 students will be able to enter an archeology
							site and work together via multiplayer to achieve various learning outcomes.</p>

							<h2>How To Play</h2>
							<p>The game is built for standing room VR with hand controllers.  Controller triggers allow player to choose a destination to walk to.  Teleportation is unavailable due to the need to perform
							trans-sec survey which require walking.  The grips are used to pick up and hold objects.  The left wrist holds a watch that the player can use to view a map, teleport back to the starting area,
							manage inventory, and return to the main menu.</p>

							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>The core gameplay loop is divided into 3 phases.  The beginning phase has players gathered around a table in a region where the archeology sites are present.  At this table players are
							given a briefing on their task and examples of potential artifacts.  After players have discussed the task and examined the artifact examples in front of them, they will head out into the
							region of Ambrosia.  From here players can use various techniques to survey the land and identify possible artifacts.  After all possible artifacts have been found they are transported
							to the starting table where the artifacts are reviewed.  After reviewing the artifacts, players will then have to decide whether or not the possible sites are in fact archaeological sites.</p>

							<h2>Development</h2>
							<p>Development of Ambrosia was done in Unreal Engine 4 (C++) featuring VR and multiplayer.  Due to both of these factors, most of the core systems in the project were developed from scratch.
							VR in Unreal Engine is not supported natively in C++ (Blueprint only native support) so much of the initial work on the project was developing the core interaction and movement systems for VR in C++.  For this I developed the 
							movement code required for the project.  There was also no native support for multiplayer VR so much of the VR core systems had to be made with multiplayer in mind.  This led to an overhaul of the VR movement and interaction
							systems so they would properly replicate their properties and values from the server to the clients.  I was also tasked with compiling and configuring the dedicated server used to host games.</p>
